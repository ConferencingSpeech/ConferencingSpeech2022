Due to the imbalanced size of the datasets, 80% of Tencent Corpus and 95% of PSTN Corpus are used for training and development. The rest 20% of Tencent Corpus, 5% of PSTN Corpus, and newly created TUB corpus are used for evaluation test in this challenge. We aim to make the impairment situation and score distribution in the divided dataset as even as possible.

In summary, there are  4372 clips for the evaluation test in this challenge. 
They are composed of Chinese, English, and German, and consider background noise,  speech enhancement system, reverberation, codecs, packet-loss and other possible online conference voice impairment scenarios.

The download link of the validation test set has been emailed to the participating teams.
